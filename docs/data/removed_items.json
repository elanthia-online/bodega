If you use the special noun \"raxiara,\" you would NOT use agara-fae, dreamfire, or panel as the term \"raxiara\" explicitly indicates it is a dreamfire panel bracelet.  If a custom show is added, it will replace the first sentence of LOOK, but the additional text about attachment points and current panel will always appear after the show description.",

The chosen color must make sense when describing magical illusion energy.  Great choices include: white, crimson, cerulean, viridian, periwinkle, or colorful.  Avoid words like: lemon, iridescent blue, faded grey, terracotta, or copper.",

Any adjectives describing the material MUST occur after a color adjective when considering rules for adjective-order.  In many of the illusion style messages, the illusion color directly precedes illusion material and so they must make adjective-order sense.  The material options that make the most sense will often be light, airy, individually distinct, transparent, and/or reflective.  Great choices include: motes of light, bubbles, ethereal leaves, water droplets, smoke wisps, or sparks.",
