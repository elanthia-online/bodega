You should also be explicit with the merchant about what sort of liquid is contained within it.  The liquid will always need to make sense within this phrasing:  \"a circular stain of <liquid descriptor> <liquid noun>\" -- and it must be appropriate for pouring out and leaving a visible stain on the ground, such as \"blood\", \"venom,\" and things of that nature.

                  "This stunning nautilus shell ocarina is a genuine nautilus shell, a masterpiece of nature's design.  Its elegantly spiraled form showcases a series of smooth, flowing curves that taper gracefully to a point, embodying the delicate balance of oceanic beauty.  The shell glimmers in a soft light peach hue, reminiscent of sun-kissed coral, with subtle pearlescent undertones that shift gently with movement.  Intricate ridges spiral outward from the center, creating a mesmerizing pattern that draws the eye, while the polished exterior reflects hints of the surrounding landscape like a serene mirror.  Its organic texture and natural sheen evoke the mysteries of the sea, making it not just an instrument but a striking piece of coastal artistry.",
