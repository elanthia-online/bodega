You should also be explicit with the merchant about what sort of liquid is contained within it.  The liquid will always need to make sense within this phrasing:  \"a circular stain of <liquid descriptor> <liquid noun>\" -- and it must be appropriate for pouring out and leaving a visible stain on the ground, such as \"blood\", \"venom,\" and things of that nature.
